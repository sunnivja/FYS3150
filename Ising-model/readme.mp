This repository contains all the program files and figures used in project 4 of the course FYS3150: Computational Physics. 
The project was built up using classes containing examples and relevant functions for the Ising model and Metropolis algorithm.
Therefore, I recommend using QTCreator to evaluate the program codes, as this IDE is well suited for classes.
